# Tokyo .NET Night

Hey there :wave:, thanks for reaching out!
Here is my version of famous [Tokyo Night Theme](https://github.com/tokyo-night/tokyo-night-vscode-theme)
for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) editor that was later adopted and used as inspiration for NeoVim theme [tokyonight.nvim](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim).

All this themes differ from one another at some point so do mine. 
Reason why this repo even exist is that Tokyo Night is a very great theme but sadly it works well with `forntend` formats like `css`, `js`, `html` etc. 
There for I decided to make my own version of it but for `.NET` specifically so languages like `C#` or `F#` and any othe .NET related formats supported by a platform are highlighted correctly so it's easy to read trough the code.
